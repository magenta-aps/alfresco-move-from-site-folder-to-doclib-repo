Alfresco repository module - Move from site folder to document library
======================================================================

This module moves documents placed in a site folder to the site's documentLibrary folder.

The main use case is when people accidentally place documents there when
connecting to Alfresco via IMAP, instead of placing them in the site's
documentLibrary folder.
